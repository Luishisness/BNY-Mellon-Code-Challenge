UI sample application
We are looking for a simple proof of HTML / CSS / JS skills in the form of a small CRUD application. You may use whatever JS libraries you are most comfortable with - we love anything MVC! Single page or multi are both ok, there is no “right” answer on this. 
This app should consist of at least the following views:
-	List all clients: Should be a table or some other way to display the data from sampleData.json. 
o	Should include the ability to sort data by field (ascending or descending)
o	Clicking on any entry should take you to the edit page for that row

-	Add client: This view should be a form with all the fields included in sampleData.json, each should be editable. 
o	All fields should be required
o	After form submission display a message to the user indicating success or failure
o	Provide a button or link to return to the list all page
o	It is not necessary to persist any additions or edits between sessions – in memory storage is sufficient

-	Edit client: This view should be the same as the add view, except it should update entries rather than creating now ones
Design is not important, however the app should be responsive – please use the provided wireframes for guidance. 
When you are finished please deliver your source via github, bitbucket, or emailed zip file.
